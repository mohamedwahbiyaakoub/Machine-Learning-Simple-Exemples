# Linear Regression

This file contains code that helps you get started on the linear exercise. 

In this exercise, you will implement linear regression and get to see it work on data so we need
to know two mathematics functions; `cost function` and `Gradient Descent`

### 1. Cost Function :
We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function. 
This takes an average difference (actually a fancier version of an average) of all
the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's and the actual output y's.

```
$J(\theta_{0}, \theta_{1}) = \frac{1}{2m}$
```
